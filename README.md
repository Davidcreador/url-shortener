## How to setup the application
- First clone the repo
- `cd` into server folder and install npm modules `npm install` or `yarn`
- `cd` into client folder and install npm modules `npm install` or `yarn`
- After these steps now in each folder you can run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the application
- If you want to make changes in the server folder you can use this script `yarn run dev` to run *nodemon* to run restarts in the server automatically
- Provide an `.env` file to add environment variables `HOST` - `PORT` - `DB_URI` are the ones I am using for this app to run properly
